# iOS-MVVM-DataBinding-Observable-Swift

 **Observer** is a behavioral design pattern that allows some objects to notify other objects about changes in their state.

## MVVM Component:

**View Controller:** 

It only performs things related to UI — Show/get information. Part of the view layer

**View Model:** 

It receives information from VC, handles all this information, and sends it back to VC.

**Model:** 

This is only your model, nothing much here. It’s the same model as in MVC. It is used by VM and updates whenever VM sends new updates

## Project
  This is a demonstration of the MVVM project in which 'observers' are used to update on the view.
